        <h1>How to tune</h1>
        <p>To tune your panduri, you need to turn the pegs at the top. Because of the way the pegs stick out the sides, the strings are arranged in an unintuitive way: the highest peg is attached to the middle string, the lone peg on the right side is attached to the string on the left, and the lowest peg is attached to the string on the right. If your panduri has metal pegs, it may still be strung this way, probably just due to people being used to the strings being arranged like this.</p>
        <p>The panduri does not seem to have a standardized tuning. Panduri players frequently retune their instruments to match their voices or to change the key of the song. There is, however, a standardized relative tuning.</p>
        <p>I'm going to talk about some theory here. Strictly speaking, you don't need to know music theory to be able to play the panduri, but if you do know theory, you'll have a deeper understanding of the music. In my opinion, the most accurate way to describe the tunings is with a relative system, due to the lack of standardization, so I'll first describe the tuning in solfege (movable do) and by their scale degrees, then by the notes.</p>
        <p>The chromatic panduri is tuned to do, mi, and sol (the first, third, and fifth scale degrees in a major scale). So, this should sound like an open major chord. It is most frequently tuned to the notes A, C#, and E. I will be explaining this guide assuming AC#E tuning, as this seems to be the most accepted tuning. Remember, since panduri players will often change the tuning of their panduri in between songs, the actual chords might not always match the chord names written here.</p>
        <p>If you need a tuner, there are many free web-based tuners online or tuning apps for mobile devices. You can either find a tuner that will produce the correct tones for you to match your strings to, or you can find a tuner that will analyze the frequencies that you're making and tell you what note is being sounded. Either way is fine, and I'll provide a video link at the end of this section that shows you how to use both methods.</p>
        <p>If you don't have access to a tuner, you can also tune the panduri to itself. I'm going to show you how to do this with chord charts. The chord charts below are images of your panduri if you are looking at it standing up. The leftmost line in the picture is the leftmost and lowest-sounding string, the middle line the middle string, and the right line is the right highest-sounding string. The horizontal lines are the frets, with the first thick line being the nut at the top. The dots show you where to press the frets. If there is no dot and is instead a circle at the top, that means that string is to be played open. An x at the top means don't play that string. And finally, the notes at the top show what notes the strings are tuned to, and the notes at the bottom show what the notes are sounded when you press down on that particular fret.</p>
        <p>When you play on the fourth fret of the lowest string, it should sound the same as the middle string.</p>
        <p>When your middle string sounds the same as when you press on the fourth fret of the lowest string, play the third fret on your middle string. This should the same as the highest string.</p>
